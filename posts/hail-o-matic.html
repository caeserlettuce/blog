      <h1>Hail-o-Matic Amp</h1>
      <br>
      <p>I went to Hamfest last weekend, where i found lots of cool vintage equipment. most of which i couldn't afford.
However there were lots of bins that were labeled "6 for $1" or something similar. In one of those bins was sitting this: an Airguide Hail-O-Matic,
from probably somewhere around the 60s. Now, doing some light research, I could only find one other mention online of the Airguide Hail-O-Matic,
and it's on an <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250320112247/https://www.lildustyonline.com/auctions/9243/lot/74043-vintage-microtrac-6200-fish-finder-and-airguide-hail-o-matic-2e">auction site.</a>
I also found <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250212112132/https://www.madeinchicagomuseum.com/single-post/airguide-instrument-co/">this page</a>,
which goes into more depth about the history of Airguide.</p>

      <p>Anyways, this one was in kinda rough shape. It was missing two dials, and the screws that held the front panel to the rest of the body.</p>
